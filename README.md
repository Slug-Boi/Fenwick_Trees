# Fenwick_Trees
This repo hosts the code used in our bachelor project on Fenwick Trees at ITU

# Description
This repo will host code for manim animations that visualize how Fenwick Trees work (how do they store information, update and output based on quries. There will be some sample code for a Fenwick Tree implementation (WIP This may turn into a full fledged library at some point, hoping to use pyo3 for faster exection of heavier operations). There will potentially also be a small chapter written documenting how fenwick trees work in the style of a algorithms course book.
